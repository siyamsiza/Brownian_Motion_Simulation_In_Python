# Random Walk and Brownian Motion Simulations in Python
This repository contains Python implementations for simulating both Random Walks and Brownian Motion. These simulations serve as a practical demonstration of two fundamental concepts in stochastic processes.

## Overview
**Random Walk**: A mathematical formalization where an entity takes steps either to the left or right with equal probability. It is often used to model various phenomena in fields such as economics, physics, and computer science.

**Brownian Motion**: Also known as a Wiener process, it describes continuous random motion and is crucial in finance for modeling stock prices through stochastic calculus.

## Contents
### Random Walk Simulation

A simple implementation that generates a random walk using discrete steps.
Utilizes NumPy for numerical operations and Matplotlib for plotting the results.

### Brownian Motion Simulation

A simulation that models Brownian motion using normally distributed increments.
Similar to the random walk but represents continuous movement over time.

## Requirements
To run the simulations, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy matplotlib

## Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/siyamsiza/Brownian_Motion_Simulation_In_Python


## Conclusion

Both simulations illustrate key concepts in stochastic processes and have applications across various scientific fields. The Random Walk consists of discrete steps taken at fixed intervals, while Brownian Motion represents continuous movement.
